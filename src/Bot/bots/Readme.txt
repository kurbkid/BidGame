a bot must be defined as a module that has the 3 functions 
prompt_bets(player)
prompt_order(equals,modPlayer)
prompt_resource_choice(options,player)

the bots may have access to the state and params global variables of BidGame. Together with player indicating who they are. This shoulds be enough to build something on.
